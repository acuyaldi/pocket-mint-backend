# Agent Rules — Pocket Mint Backend

Authoritative project workflow for this repository (Express 5 + TypeScript +
Prisma 7 + Supabase Postgres). Domain-specific invariants live in the skills
below; this file owns branching, verification, secrets, and load order.

## Skill Load Order

Always read this file first. Then read, **only when the task touches that area**:

1. `authentication-security.skill.md` — auth, middleware, users, CORS, rate limiting
2. `financial-logic.skill.md` — wallets, transactions, transfers, installments, dashboard, reconciliation
3. `prisma-database.skill.md` — Prisma schema, migrations, generated client, pooling, DB deployment
4. `backend-api.skill.md` — routes, controllers, request DTOs, serializers, services
5. `deployment-operations.skill.md` — Railway, Supabase environments, CI/CD, migration rollout, secrets

Do **not** load frontend UI skills. `.claude/archive/frontend/` is historical
reference only, never part of the load order.

## Git Branch Roles

- `master` = Production
- `dev` = Staging
- `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*` = task branches

Every task: `git checkout dev` → pull latest `dev` → create a task branch →
commit there → open a PR targeting `dev`.

Never:
- commit or push directly to `dev` or `master`
- target a PR at `master` without an explicit written release instruction

## Focus

- One task at a time. Inspect before creating — check whether the file,
  function, endpoint, or migration already exists.
- No unrelated refactors inside a task.
- When a task eventually affects the frontend, the backend endpoint/service
  comes first.
- Do not claim completion without evidence (command output).

## Verification

A backend task is done only when all of these pass:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
npx vitest run
npx prisma validate
git diff --check
git status
```

`dist/` is **committed** and CI fails on `git diff --exit-code` after a build —
so after changing `src/`, rerun `npm run build` and commit the resulting `dist/`
changes together with the source.

When source or build packaging changes, additionally verify the generated
Prisma client is packaged:

```bash
test -f dist/generated/prisma/client.js
node -e "require('./dist/generated/prisma/client')"
```

## Secrets

Never:
- commit `.env` or `.env.local` (they are git-ignored; history already leaked
  once — do not repeat it)
- print tokens, DB passwords, JWT secrets, API keys, or connection URLs in
  output, logs, docs, or commit messages
- put real values in `.env.example` — placeholders only
- use Production credentials for Dev/Staging
- restore the retired `x-api-key` / `x-user-id` / `x-user-email` authentication

## Environment Isolation

- `dev` branch → Railway Staging → Supabase Dev project
- `master` branch → Railway Production → Supabase Production project

Never mix these: no Production `DATABASE_URL` in staging, no staging JWT source
in production, no shared database between the two.

## Common Mistakes

- Committing on `dev` because "it's just a small fix" — always a task branch.
- Forgetting to rebuild and commit `dist/` after a `src/` change (CI diff check fails).
- Running a Prisma migration command against the `.env` database "to test" —
  see `prisma-database.skill.md`; use a disposable local PostgreSQL.
- Declaring done without running the verification commands.
