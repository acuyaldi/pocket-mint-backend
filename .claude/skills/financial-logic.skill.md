# Financial Logic — Pocket Mint Backend

**Source of truth:** This document. It was reconciled 2026-07-18 against
PD-001 (Approved), backend implementation, and 381 automated tests.
When code, tests, and this document disagree, treat this document as the
canonical rule — then verify whether the code or the document is wrong and
flag the conflict. Do NOT silently "fix" code to match old documentation.

## 1. Wallet Classification

### Asset wallets

`CASH`, `BANK`, `E_WALLET`

- Balance stored as **positive** (Rp 5.000.000,00 = `5000000.00`).
- Contribute to `totalAset` at face value.
- Source: `classifyWalletForNetWorth` in `src/utils/financial.ts`.

### Debt wallets

`CREDIT_CARD`, `PAYLATER`, `LOAN`

- Outstanding debt stored as **negative** balance (Rp 2.000.000,00 utang = `-2000000.00`).
- `totalUtang` = `abs(balance)` — always a positive number for display.
- Classification is by wallet **type**, never by balance sign.
- `LOAN` is a debt wallet whose opening balance is `-principal` (set at create,
  `wallet.service.ts:120`). LOAN rejects credit billing fields (`creditLimit`,
  `cutoffDay`, `paymentDueDay`).
- Source: `classifyWalletForNetWorth` in `src/utils/financial.ts`.

### Wallet create rules

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Asset opening balance ≥ 0 | Backend (`wallet.service.ts:107-108`) |
| CREDIT_CARD/PAYLATER requires `creditLimit > 0` | Backend (`wallet.service.ts:93-98`) |
| LOAN requires `principal > 0` | Backend (`wallet.service.ts:113-115`) |
| LOAN rejects `creditLimit`/`cutoffDay`/`paymentDueDay` | Backend (`wallet.service.ts:117-118`) |
| Balance is NEVER editable via wallet update | Backend (`BALANCE_UPDATE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `wallet.service.ts:208-222`) |

---

## 2. Net Worth (PD-001 — Approved)

```
totalAset  = Σ(balance) for ASSET wallets (CASH, BANK, E_WALLET)
totalUtang = Σ(|balance|) for DEBT wallets (CREDIT_CARD, PAYLATER, LOAN)
netWorth   = totalAset − totalUtang
```

### Concrete example

| Wallet | Type | Balance |
|---|---|---|
| BCA | BANK | 5.000.000,00 |
| GoPay | E_WALLET | 500.000,00 |
| Mandiri CC | CREDIT_CARD | −2.000.000,00 |
| Akulaku | PAYLATER | −1.000.000,00 |

```
totalAset  = 5.000.000 + 500.000 = 5.500.000
totalUtang = 2.000.000 + 1.000.000 = 3.000.000
netWorth   = 5.500.000 − 3.000.000 = 2.500.000
```

### Rules

- Net worth **may be negative**. Never clamp to zero.
- `totalUtang` is **always** the absolute value of debt balances — displayed as
  a positive number.
- Installment debt is **already counted exactly once** inside the wallet's
  outstanding balance. Do NOT subtract installment `grandTotal` again.
- All three values (`totalAset`, `totalUtang`, `netWorth`) are computed from
  the same wallet snapshot (same reporting cutoff). Never mix snapshots.
- Source: `calculateNetWorth` in `src/utils/financial.ts`.
- Test: `dashboardQueryService.test.ts` — 8 cases, explicit PD-001 assertion.

### Historical note (deprecated)

A previous July 2026 product decision defined `netWorth = Σ(ASSET balances)`
(assets only, debt excluded). That decision was superseded by **PD-001
(Approved 2026-07-14)**. The old formula is **no longer valid anywhere**.
If you encounter code or documentation claiming assets-only net worth,
flag it — do not replicate it.

---

## 3. Transaction Effects

Single source of truth: `computeBalanceEffect` / `reverseBalanceEffect` /
`applyBalanceDeltas` in `src/domain/transactionBalance.ts`.
Never re-implement the switch — reuse these functions.

### INCOME

- **Effect:** `+amount` to source wallet.
- **Net Worth impact:** Increases `totalAset` (if wallet is ASSET).
  Increases net worth.
- **Validation:** Source wallet must be ASSET (`CASH`/`BANK`/`E_WALLET`).
  INCOME targeting CREDIT_CARD, PAYLATER, or LOAN is **rejected** with 400.
  Source: `transaction.service.ts:141-143`. Tested: PM-STAB-007 cases.

### EXPENSE

- **Effect:** `−amount` from source wallet.
- **Net Worth impact:** Decreases `totalAset` (if wallet is ASSET).
  Decreases net worth.
- **Validation:** LOAN wallet rejected as expense source
  (`transaction.service.ts:138-139`).

### TRANSFER (asset-to-asset)

- **Effect:** `−amount` source, `+amount` destination. One `Transaction` row
  with `walletId` + `toWalletId`.
- **Net Worth impact:** **Zero.** Total assets unchanged — this is value
  relocation, not creation or destruction. Net worth invariant is preserved.
- **Validation:** Source must be CASH/BANK/E_WALLET (`TRANSFER_SOURCE_TYPES`).
  Source ≠ destination. Source balance must be sufficient. Destination must
  belong to same user. Category forbidden.

### TRANSFER (debt repayment / installment payment)

- **Effect:** `−amount` from ASSET source, `+amount` (credit) to DEBT wallet.
- **Recorded as:** `type: "TRANSFER"` — **NOT EXPENSE**.
- **Net Worth impact:** **Zero at the moment of payment.** Assets shrink and
  debt shrinks by the same amount, so net worth is unchanged. The expense
  that created the debt already reduced net worth at creation time.
- Source: `installment-payment.service.ts:99-103`.
- Tested: `installmentPaymentService.test.ts`.

### Summary: Which transactions affect Net Worth?

| Transaction | Net Worth change |
|---|---|
| INCOME to ASSET wallet | **+amount** (assets ↑) |
| EXPENSE from ASSET wallet | **−amount** (assets ↓) |
| CREDIT EXPENSE (installment create) | **−grandTotal** (debt ↑, net worth ↓) |
| TRANSFER asset → asset | **0** (value relocation only) |
| TRANSFER asset → debt (payment) | **0** (assets ↓, debt ↓, cancel out) |
| TRANSFER debt → anything | Rejected (debt cannot be transfer source) |

### TRANSFER destination hardening note

Backend does NOT restrict TRANSFER destination wallet type at the generic
endpoint (`POST /v1/transactions`). Only the source type is restricted.
Frontend restricts destination to ASSET wallets. A direct API call could
transfer into a DEBT wallet outside the installment payment flow —
mathematically net-worth-neutral but would desync `paidTerms` from wallet
balance. Low risk (not reachable from UI). Guard tracked as hardening item.

---

## 4. Credit / PayLater Expense (Installment Creation)

When an EXPENSE transaction uses a CREDIT_CARD or PAYLATER source wallet,
the backend **always** creates an Installment row. This is a single code path
in `transaction.service.ts:createTransaction`, `isCreditExpense` branch.

### Two billing modes

| Mode | `kind` | `installmentMonths` | Tenor validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FULL` | `FULL` | 1 | Full payment next cycle |
| `INSTALLMENT` | `INSTALLMENT` | 2–120 | Minimum 2 terms |

### Installment plan arithmetic

```
totalInterest = round(principal × (rate/100) × months)   // flat interest
grandTotal    = round(principal + totalInterest)           // total liability
monthlyAmount = round(grandTotal / months)                // recurring term
finalMonthlyAmount = grandTotal − monthlyAmount × (months − 1)
```

All in `Prisma.Decimal`, `ROUND_HALF_UP`, scale 2. Source:
`src/domain/installment.ts`.

### Example (principal 100.000, rate 2.6%, 3 months)

```
totalInterest    = round(100000 × 0.026 × 3) = 7.800
grandTotal       = 107.800
monthlyAmount    = round(107800 / 3) = 35.933,33
finalMonthlyAmount = 107800 − 35933.33 × 2 = 35.933,34
```

Schedule: term 1 = 35.933,33 | term 2 = 35.933,33 | term 3 = 35.933,34 → sums to 107.800,00 exactly.

### Balance effect at creation

- Wallet is debited by **`grandTotal`** (full liability) at creation time.
  NOT by `monthlyAmount`. This is a single atomic `$transaction`.
- The `Transaction` row stores `monthlyAmount` for display, but
  `computeBalanceEffect` with `isInstallment: true` + `installmentGrandTotal`
  always uses `grandTotal` for the wallet debit.
- Source: `transaction.service.ts:246`, `transactionBalance.ts:66-73`.

### Credit limit check

```
outstanding     = |balance|                    // current debt (positive number)
remainingCredit = max(creditLimit − outstanding, 0)
```

If `grandTotal > remainingCredit` → `INSUFFICIENT_CREDIT` (400). No write occurs.
Source: `transaction.service.ts:202-208`.

### Validation summary

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Credit expense only from CREDIT_CARD/PAYLATER | Backend |
| LOAN rejected as expense source | Backend |
| Credit limit must not be exceeded | Backend |
| Interest 0–100% | Backend |
| `installmentMonths` 1–120 | Backend |
| INSTALLMENT mode requires ≥ 2 months | Backend |
| `cutoffDay` + `paymentDueDay` required (or `firstDueDate` supplied) | Backend |
| `firstDueDate` computed from cutoff cycle (`billingCycle.ts`) | Backend |

---

## 5. Installment Payment (Debt Settlement)

Endpoint: `POST /v1/bills/:id/pay` (alias `/v1/installments/:id/pay`).
Service: `installment-payment.service.ts:payInstallment`.

### Payment rules

- Installment must be `ACTIVE` and not fully paid.
- Payment source: `BANK`, `CASH`, or `E_WALLET` (`ALLOWED_SOURCE_TYPES`).
  **E_WALLET IS allowed** — confirmed by implementation and tests.
- Payment amount must equal `expectedAmount`:
  - Regular term: `installment.monthlyAmount`
  - Final term: `computeFinalMonthlyAmount(grandTotal, monthlyAmount, months)`
    (absorbs the rounding remainder).
- Payment recorded as `type: "TRANSFER"` (NOT expense) — one row with
  `walletId` = source, `toWalletId` = debt wallet.
- All within one `$transaction`: create Transaction row + 2× wallet update +
  update Installment (`paidTerms` + `nextDueDate` + `status`).

### Term progression

```
nextPaidTerms = paidTerms + 1
isFinalTerm   = nextPaidTerms >= installmentMonths
nextStatus    = isFinalTerm ? SETTLED : ACTIVE
nextDueDate   = SETTLED ? unchanged : addBillingMonth(current, 1)
```

### finalMonthlyAmount in payment

The final term uses `computeFinalMonthlyAmount` so the schedule sums to
`grandTotal` exactly. Paying the regular `monthlyAmount` on the final term
is **rejected** (`INVALID_AMOUNT`). Omitting `amount` in the request body
(or passing the exact computed amount) charges the correct final amount.

Source: `installment-payment.service.ts:60-72`.
Tested: `installmentPaymentService.test.ts` — PM-STAB-006.

---

## 6. Installment Settlement (SETTLED Status)

- `status = SETTLED` when `paidTerms >= installmentMonths` after the final
  payment.
- Once SETTLED, `payInstallment` rejects further payments with
  `"Tagihan sudah lunas"` (409 CONFLICT).
- After SETTLED, the debt wallet balance should be **exactly zero** (all
  `grandTotal` has been repaid through TRANSFER payments).
- The `finalMonthlyAmount` mechanism ensures the repayment schedule sums to
  `grandTotal` exactly — no rounding remainder trapped in the wallet.
- Source: `installment-payment.service.ts:56-57, 89-90`.

---

## 7. Double Deduction Prevention

- **Create:** `applyBalanceDeltas` uses atomic `balance: { increment }` —
  no read-modify-write race.
- **Update:** Reverse persisted old effect → update row → apply new effect.
  Both derived from stored DB row, never from request data.
- **Delete:** Reverse the persisted effect from the stored row.
  Installment delete reverses `grandTotal` (not `monthlyAmount`).
- **Installment payment:** Creates exactly one TRANSFER row. The original
  expense already deducted the wallet at creation; the payment does NOT
  deduct again — it moves money from asset to debt wallet (transfer, not expense).
- **Multi-step mutations:** All wrapped in `db.$transaction(...)` — atomic
  commit or full rollback. No partial writes.

Source: `transaction.service.ts`, `installment-payment.service.ts`,
`transactionBalance.ts`.

---

## 8. Transaction Update and Delete

### Update rules

- Installment-linked transactions: **refused** (409 CONFLICT).
  Manage installments through their dedicated endpoint.
- Legacy transfers (missing `toWalletId`): **refused** (409).
  Delete and recreate.
- Non-installment update: reverse-then-apply inside `$transaction`.
- Re-targeting an INCOME onto a DEBT wallet during update: **rejected** before
  any write (PM-STAB-007 guard on update path too).
- Source: `transaction.service.ts:294-437`.

### Delete rules

- Non-installment: reverse the exact persisted effect, delete row.
- Installment: reverse the persisted `grandTotal` effect (NOT `monthlyAmount`),
  delete Transaction row, then delete Installment row. All in `$transaction`.
- Legacy transfer without `toWalletId`: **refused** (409).
  Manual reconciliation required.
- Source: `transaction.service.ts:446-498`.

---

## 9. Reporting Cutoff and Timezone

- **Reporting timezone:** `Asia/Jakarta` (configurable via `REPORTING_TIMEZONE`
  env var, defaults to `Asia/Jakarta`).
- **Date parsing:** Date-only strings (`2026-07-18`) resolve to reporting-local
  midnight. Full timestamps must carry an offset or `Z`.
- **Period boundaries:** Half-open `[startInclusive, endExclusive)` —
  NEVER use `lte` on end bounds.
- **Source:** `src/domain/reportingTime.ts`, `src/config/index.ts`.

### Reporting month

```
Month 2026-07: [2026-07-01T00:00:00+07:00, 2026-08-01T00:00:00+07:00)
```

### Transaction date semantics

- `Transaction.date` is the **business date** (when the transaction happened).
- `Transaction.createdAt` is the audit/tie-breaker timestamp only.
- All reporting queries filter on `date`, not `createdAt`.

### Sparkline

- Seven reporting-calendar days, oldest → newest.
- Points before wallet creation date are `null` (never `0`).
- Computed from current balance walked backwards through effects.
- Future-dated transactions excluded from realized closes.
- Source: `wallet-query.service.ts:87-146`.

---

## 10. Analytics Rules

### Cash flow aggregation

- `getAggregateCashFlowEffect` in `src/domain/reportingEffect.ts`:
  - INCOME → `+amount`
  - EXPENSE → `−amount`
  - TRANSFER → **0** (excluded from income/expense aggregates)
- Transfers (including debt repayments) are **never** counted as income or
  expense in aggregate reporting.

### Wallet-level reporting

- `getWalletReportingEffect` in `src/domain/reportingEffect.ts`:
  - INCOME source wallet → `+amount`
  - EXPENSE source wallet → `−amount`
  - TRANSFER source → `−amount`, TRANSFER destination → `+amount`
  - Installment expenses use `grandTotal` (not `monthlyAmount`)

### Known limitation (PM-STAB-002)

The default transaction endpoint (`GET /v1/transactions`) auto-filters to the
current reporting month. For multi-month analytics, use
`GET /v1/transactions/all` with client-side date filtering. The frontend
analytics page currently does NOT do this — period selectors "3 months" /
"6 months" are non-functional. This is a known issue, not a documentation error.

---

## 11. Installment Lifecycle (Current Implementation)

### Implemented

- **Create:** Front-loaded balance deduction (full `grandTotal` at creation).
  Status: ACTIVE. `currentTerm: 1`, `paidTerms: 0`.
- **Pay:** Manual per-term payment via `POST /v1/bills/:id/pay`.
  Term advances, status → SETTLED on final payment.
- **Cancellation:** Not yet implemented in backend. Status `CANCELLED` exists
  in schema but no endpoint transitions to it.

### Not yet implemented (PD-003 Draft)

- Automatic monthly term advancement (calendar-based lifecycle).
- Catch-up processing after downtime.
- Early payoff calculation.
- Cancellation with balance reversal.
- These are product decisions in Draft status — do not implement without
  explicit approval.

---

## 12. Admin Fee and Interest

### Interest

- Flat percentage per month: `totalInterest = round(principal × rate/100 × months)`.
- Fully implemented and included in `grandTotal`.
- Source: `computeInstallmentPlan` in `src/domain/installment.ts`.

### Admin fee

- Schema stores: `adminFee` (amount), `adminFeeType` (FLAT/PERCENT),
  `totalAdminFee`.
- **NOT included in `grandTotal` by current `computeInstallmentPlan`.**
  The `grandTotal` formula only uses principal + interest.
- This is a known gap — PD-004 (Draft) recommends including admin fee in
  `grandTotal`. The schema has the columns ready; the calculation does not
  yet use them.
- Status: **Open decision.** Do not add admin fee to grandTotal without
  approved PD-004.

---

## 13. Money Precision and Rounding

```
Scale:   2 decimal places (MONEY_SCALE = 2)
Mode:    ROUND_HALF_UP
Type:    Prisma.Decimal (Decimal(15, 2) in schema)
```

### Rules

- **All** persisted and computed money is `Prisma.Decimal`. No `number`,
  `parseFloat`, `parseInt`, or `Math.round` in services/domain code.
- Comparison: use `.equals()`, `.lessThan()`, `.greaterThan()` — never
  `===` or `<` on coerced numbers.
- `toMoney(value)` = `value.toDecimalPlaces(2, ROUND_HALF_UP)` — use this
  when rounding is needed.
- `MONEY_SCALE` and `MONEY_ROUNDING` exported from `src/domain/installment.ts`.
- Decimal → JSON number conversion happens **only** in controller serializers
  at the response boundary. See `backend-api.skill.md`.

### Common mistake

```typescript
// WRONG — float comparison loses precision
if (Number(balance) < Number(amount)) { ... }

// RIGHT — Decimal comparison
if (balance.lessThan(amount)) { ... }
```

---

## 14. Operations That Must Be Atomic

Every multi-write financial operation MUST run inside `db.$transaction(...)`:

| Operation | Writes inside transaction |
|---|---|
| Create regular transaction | 1× Transaction + 1–2× Wallet update |
| Create installment (credit expense) | 1× Installment + 1× Transaction + 2× Wallet update |
| Update transaction | Reverse old deltas + 1× Transaction update + Apply new deltas |
| Delete transaction (regular) | Reverse deltas + 1× Transaction delete |
| Delete transaction (installment) | Reverse grandTotal + 1× Transaction delete + 1× Installment delete |
| Pay installment | 1× Transaction create + 2× Wallet update + 1× Installment update |

Wallet CRUD (create/update/delete) is a single write per operation — no
`$transaction` needed outside of cascade.

---

## 15. Reconciliation

- `reconcileWalletBalances` in `src/domain/transactionBalance.ts`:
  recomputes expected balance from `initialBalance + Σ(effects)`.
- Pure, deterministic, read-only. Never mutates data.
- Script: `src/scripts/reconcile.ts --audit` — read-only audit mode.
- Never repair silently. Any write/repair requires explicit user approval.
- Reconciliation formula for each wallet:
  ```
  expected = initialBalance + Σ(computeBalanceEffect for each transaction)
  drift    = stored − expected
  ```
- Transfers are reconciled symmetrically (both sides from the same stored row).

---

## 16. Transfer Representation (PM-STAB-009A — Resolved)

All transfers use the `Transaction` model with `type: "TRANSFER"`, `walletId`
(source), and `toWalletId` (destination). The separate `Transfer` model was
removed in PM-STAB-009A (2026-07-18) — it had zero application readers or
writers across the entire codebase. PD-007 declares Transaction-with-toWalletId
as the sole canonical transfer representation.

---

## 17. Ledger Integrity

- Wallet balances change **only** through transaction/installment orchestration
  (`applyBalanceDeltas` inside `$transaction`, atomic increments).
- Direct balance overwrite via wallet update: rejected with
  `BALANCE_UPDATE_NOT_ALLOWED`. An unchanged echo is tolerated.
- `initialBalance` is the reconciliation anchor — set once at wallet creation,
  never modified.
- Delete = reverse the persisted effect (computed from stored rows, never
  from request data).

---

## 18. Quick Reference — Common Mistakes

1. **Computing net worth as assets only** — PD-001 (Approved) defines it as
   `assets − debt`. The assets-only formula is deprecated.
2. **Treating debt repayment as EXPENSE** — Debt repayment is `TRANSFER`.
   The expense already happened when the debt was created.
3. **Using `Number(amount)` or float comparison** — all money math is
   `Prisma.Decimal`. Use `.equals()`, `.lessThan()`, etc.
4. **Reversing an installment by `monthlyAmount`** — always use `grandTotal`.
5. **Building month ranges with `new Date(y, m, 1)`** — use
   `getReportingMonthRange` from `reportingTime.ts`.
6. **Assuming E-WALLET cannot pay bills** — it can. `ALLOWED_SOURCE_TYPES`
   includes `E_WALLET`.
7. **Creating INCOME against a DEBT wallet** — backend rejects this. Do not
   rely on frontend-only guards.

---

## Appendix A — Deprecated Decisions

### Net Worth = Assets Only (July 2026, superseded)

A previous product decision defined `netWorth = Σ(ASSET balances)`, excluding
debt. This was implemented in an earlier version of `calculateNetWorth` and
documented in previous versions of this skill file.

**Superseded by:** PD-001 (Approved 2026-07-14) — Option C (Separate Net Worth
and Total Assets), defining `netWorth = totalAset − totalUtang`.

**Migration:** Backend `calculateNetWorth`, `dashboardQueryService`, and
`walletQueryService.getNetWorth` were updated to implement PD-001.
Tests (`dashboardQueryService.test.ts`) explicitly assert the new formula.

**Frontend:** The dashboard page still computes net worth as assets only
(PM-STAB-001, Critical). This is a known bug, not a valid product decision.
