 * Prisma 7 uses the `client` engine, which requires a driver adapter to talk to
 * PostgreSQL. This factory owns the composition:
 *
 *   pg.Pool → PrismaPg adapter → PrismaClient({ adapter })
 *
 * The pool is created and OWNED here so its lifecycle is explicit: `close()`
 * disconnects Prisma and ends the pool exactly once. The adapter is told NOT to
 * end the pool itself (`disposeExternalPool` stays false) so cleanup happens in
 * one place and never double-runs.
 *
 * No connection string is ever logged or embedded in an error message.
