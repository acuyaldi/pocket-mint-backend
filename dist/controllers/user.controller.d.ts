     * `requireVerifiedJwt`) — it is the sole authority for the local row's `id`.

     * THEMSELVES. Email prefers the verified `email` claim, falling back to the
     * body only when the token carries none. Idempotent: a known user is a no-op
     * (200); an unknown one is created (201). `password` and any other unexpected
     * field are ignored — credentials are owned by Supabase Auth, never stored.
