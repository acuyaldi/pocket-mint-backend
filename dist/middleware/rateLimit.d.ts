 * prefix keeps IP buckets in a separate namespace from user buckets (a user id
 * that happens to look like an IP can never collide with a real IP key).
 *
 * This is the key for the PRE-AUTH general limiter: it runs before
 * authentication (mounted globally on `/api`), so no trusted identity exists yet
 * — it protects the token/API-key verification path and keys purely by IP.

 * only as a defensive default if it is ever mounted without a preceding auth
 * gate.
 *
 * Only the trusted `req.auth.userId` (set from a verified JWT `sub`) is ever
 * used — never a self-asserted `x-user-id` header and never a body/query
 * `userId`. Keys carry no token.

 * Unlike the general limiter (gated at mount in app.ts), this one is registered
 * directly on routes, so it honors `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` via `skip` — disabling
 * rate limiting turns it into a passthrough.
